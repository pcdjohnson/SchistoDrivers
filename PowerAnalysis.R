# This is a simulation-based power analysis, where the project data is    #
# simulated and analysed multiple times under different study design      #
# scenarios, and power is estimated as the proportion of simulated        #
# analyses that achieve the desired outcome (e.g. detecting a true        # 
# driver of treatment failure).                                           #
